# Quick Start

The following guide should quickly get you through the process of connecting your data to Datafi with a set of easy to follow instructions.

**_(A sample dataset is available when you register for an account in case you want to jump right into exploring)_**

## Steps

1. [Connect Your Data](#step-1-connect-your-data)
   - [Local Edge Server Setup (optional)](#local-edge-server-setup)
   - [Datafi hosted Edge Server Setup](#hosted-edge-server-setup)
2. [Configure Dataset](#step-2-configure-your-dataset)
3. [Access Your Data](#step-3-viewing-your-data)

## Step 1: Connect Your Data

There are three ways to connect your data to your Datafi workspace. 1) you can setup a local Edge Server, 2) use a Datafi hosted Edge Server, or 3) directly upload CSV files

You first need to create a user account and workspace. If you don’t have an account <a href="https://home.datafi.us/register" target="_blank">click here to register for a free account</a>

### Local Edge Server Setup

Complete the following steps to setup a local Edge Server.

1. Install Docker Desktop and complete the setup steps (ref: <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_blank">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop</a> )
2. Verify Docker has been setup by running the following and confirm **Hello from Docker!** reply:
   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```
3. Open the terminal and pull the latest edge-server image then run the Edge Server container with the following commands:
   ```
   docker pull datafi/es:latest
   docker run --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 datafi/es:latest
   ```
   Note: you  will probably get a warning that says `error opening socket connection: token missing in policy`, you can ignore that warning now, and continue to the next step
4. Open <a href="http://localhost/setup" target="_blank">http://localhost/setup</a> in a browser to configure the Edge Server and enter the following: 

   -  edge server Base Address (in this case you can keep it as `localhost` as you are running the edge server docker container locally)
   -  point of contact email address (in the next step you will get an email to this email address, so make sure you have access to the email inbox), 
   -  data source name, 
   -  data source type, 
   -  host and login details for the datasorce 

5. Click **CHECK** button above (it will verify if the credentials are correct and is able to connect), if passed you will see a submit button at the bottom of the page, click **Submit** to continue. 
   - A confirmation screen appears when the process completes
   - copy the **KEY** for the next step
6. From the terminal:
   - stop the Edge Server by entering **CTRL+C**
   - restart with the following command using the **KEY** as the **_KEY_** variable, without < >.
   ```
   docker run --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -e KEY=<KEY> datafi/es:latest
   ```
7. The Point of Contact email provided above will receive an email with a link to **ADD DATASET** . Before clicking on the link, make sure you have already [signed up for a Free Datafi Account](https://home.datafi.us/register) and is currently logged in. 

8. Follow the **ADD DATASET** instructions and proceed to [**Step 2.**](#step-2-configure-your-dataset)

- Troubleshooting: If you don't see any data from the dataset, repeat #6

### Hosted Edge Server Setup

Complete the following steps to setup a Datafi hosted Edge Server for your dataset.

1. From your workspace, click the blue **ADD** button in the upper left and select **Add Dataset**
2. Select the type of the data source to add then enter the host and user details. The user must be **_read-only_** access
3. Click the **ADD DATASET** button and proceed to [**Step 2**](#step-2-configure-your-dataset).


## Step 2: Configure your Dataset

After Completing the step 1, you should see the Edit Dataset dialog which will allow you to configure and edit the details for the dataset you just added. The four tabs we will look at for configuring a dataset are: Overview, Schema, Users, and Rules.If you are not planning to invite other users to your workspace, then the Overview page is probably the only section you need to complete.

Click **Save** continue and proceed to [**Step 3**](#step-3-viewing-your-data)

(The dialog can be accessed again any time by clicking the **Edit** icon of the dataset you are currently active on, in case you close it before you are finished or want to make a change.)

### Overview

In the dataset Overview you can update the name, description, and tags for your dataset.  This information is used to help other users find this dataset and it’s contents.  

### Schema

The Schema section allows you to configure how the dataset is viewed by users with the ability to change the following:
* Icons next to fields names allow creating Dataview Links (which are similar to database joins) and External Links which allow you to link to URLs based on the data in the fields.
* Catalog Name is the visible name users will see for fields and tables.
* Accessibility Controls are the following:
    *  Access can be turned on/off completely for a field with this slider
    *  Confidentiality - This drop down allows you, the data owner, to specify a confidentiality level for each field.  Users with higher values directly or indirectly assigned are able to see the value.
    *  Sensitivity - This drop down allows you, the data owner, to specify a sensitivity level for each field.  Users with higher values directly or indirectly assigned are able to see the field.
    *  Identity -  - This drop down allows you, the data owner, to specify an identity level for each field.  Users with higher values directly or indirectly assigned are able to see the field.

* renaming tables and fields to have more user friendly names where necessary.
* The trashcan icon allows a table (aka datafile) within the dataset to be removed from view within the system; however, it does not change the underlying table and dataset. 


The Schema section allows you to configure the following:

- accessability control, determining if any specific tables or fields should be hidden/blocked.
- renaming tables and fields to have more user friendly names where necessary.
- Dataset level access rating for tables and fields can be set to have a more in depth control over who can see what information in your dataset. ([ More details about Access Ratings ](#access-rating-explained))

### Users

The User section allows you to modify access your dataset Users must be previously 

Data Owners are the users with the privilege to modify all aspects of the dataset.  All users in this category will have full access to the dataset and the ability to modify the access to the dataset.

Data Users is the section where users with limited rights are created and managed.  Each user added in this section can have specific values for Confidentiality, Sentitivity, and Identity.  When assigned a value users can see any element with a rating less than or equal to the users assigned value.  

Teams allow users to be grouped and access levels to be assigned based on the group.

### Rules
The rules sections allows you to create rules that can mask specific fields in your dataset's tables.  Rules control how data is seen by users when their specific grants are less than the values necessary to see specific fields. ([ more details on rules ](#rule-policies-explained))

## Step 3: Viewing your data

On the [Dataview](https://dataficloud.com/dataview) page you will be able to see a list of datasource that you have access to on the left side of you screen. Choosing a table from one of them will open the contents of that dataset that your [Access Rating](#access-rating-explained) permits, and mask fields according to any rules applied to that dataset.

## Access Rating Explained

One of the ways that Datafi enables you to secure your information is with Access Ratings. With Access Ratings you can have certain tables or fields be selectively visible to different individuals based off their Access Ratings.

Access Ratings are split into three different aspects, **_Confidentiality_**, **_Sensitivity_**, and **_Identity_**. Each aspect has a range of security level labels as seen below, with the values in level 0 being the least sensitive and the 5 being the most sensitive.

| Confidentiality | Accessability   | Identity      | Security Level |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Open            | Non Sensitive   | Public        | 0              |
| Limited         | Less Sensitive  | Partners      | 1              |
| Regulated       | Sensitive       | Internal Only | 2              |
| Restricted      | More Sensitive  | Exclusive     | 3              |
| Strict          | Very Sensitive  | Secure        | 4              |
| Secret          | Hyper Sensitive | Private       | 5              |

When a user tries to view the contents of a dataset, the Access Rating for that user's membership Access Rating is compared to the datasets Table and Field Access Rating, if all three aspects of that user's aspect rating does not meet or match the access ratings of a field, then that field is hidden.  Rules further modify this to allow the value returned to be altered based on ratings.

### Setting Access Ratings

Access ratings can be set in various places, and default access ratings can also be provided.

For users, Default Access Ratings can be set at a workspace level, an individual level, and an individual user per dataset level (or membership). For Datasets Default Access Ratings are set at workspace, table, and field levels.

The Default workspace user Access Ratings and Dataset Access Ratings can be set under the **Workspace Policies** tab of the administration page.

Individual user Access Ratings can be set under the **User Management** tab of the administration page. (defaults to the workspaces user default access rating)

User membership level Access Rating are set in the Edit Dataset dialog's **Users** tab. (defaults to user's individual user Access Ratings)

Table and field level Access Ratings are set in the **Schema** tab of the Edit Dataset dialog. (Table defaults to Workspaces default dataset Access Rating, and fields default to the table's Access Rating)

## Rule Policies Explained

Dataset owners are able to configure complex rules to mask dataset fields when [Access Ratings](#access-rating-explained) are insufficient. Rules can be based off of a variety of factors, such as (but not limit to) date, [user group](#user-groups-explained), and a user's Access Rating aspects (Confidentiality, Identity, Sensitivity).

### Where To Set Rules

Policy Rules can be set in two different place. An overview view of all the rules over each dataset you own can be seen on the console [Policies Page's _Rules_ tab](https://dataficloud.com/policies/rules) and is displayed as a list of rules, each with their corresponding dataset name and a description. When creating or editing a dataset, the rules for the _current dataset_ can be seen in the **Rules** tab of the dataset editor dialog. Both places are almost interchangeable and new rules can be added, removed, and edited as you see fit, the only difference is the dataset editor limits the rules to the active dataset.

### What Makes Up a Rule

A rule is divided into two main parts, the **_Condition_** and the **_Statement_**.

In the **_Conditions_** of your rule, you set the logic that will cause your rule to trigger. In this section you can add multiple sub **_Conditions_**, each with their own Property (_Date_), Condition Type (_is more than_), and Value (_1970/01/01_). By default, when using more than one, conditions use **AND** logic at the top level, however they can be merged into groups and subgroups with either **AND** or **OR** logic.

In the **_Statements_** of your rule, you set the outcome you want your rule to produce. a **_Statement_** is made up of a table, a field, and one of many anonymize options, which gives you a selection of ways to hide/mask the data in the given fields. Like **_Conditions_**, a rule can have multiple **_Statement_**, each with a different table, field, or anonymize option.
